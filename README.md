# Pair-Demo-for-Java
Demo for the Pair class in Java.

This project should help with demo-ing the Pair class for Java.

The Pair class is one of the newer additions to Java, and can help "pair-up" 
two different classes together, which should lead to some interesting applications.

To exhibit this, I am creating multiple classes within a NetBeans project.

1. PairDemoBasics 
This demonstrates the basic operations of the Pair class, by creating multiple
Pair objects, and then extracting the keys and values from them.

2. PairDemo
This more advanced class demonstrates how the Pair class may be used to return
multiple inputs from a user through a method.
