# Pair-Demo-for-Java

This project should help with demo-ing the Pair class for Java.

The Pair class is one of the newer additions to Java, and can help "pair-up" 
two different classes together, which should lead to some interesting applications.

To exhibit this, I am creating multiple classes within a NetBeans project.

1. PairDemoBasics 
This demonstrates the basic operations of the Pair class, by creating multiple
Pair objects, and then extracting the keys and values from them.

2. PairDemo
This more advanced class demonstrates how the Pair class may be used to return
multiple inputs from a user through a method.

3. PairDemo2
This final class uses a secondary class Employee. Employee objects are created and
are then used in Pair objects with Strings.

These classes will be used in conjunction with a powerpoint presentation to
demonstrate the possible uses or applications of the Pair class.
