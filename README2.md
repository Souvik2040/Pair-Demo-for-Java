# Additional-Superclass-Demo

This will be an additional demo, with the purpose of demonstrating the use 
of Pairs in conjunction with a superclass and two derived classes.

The program in use is a simulation of a two-legged race between two racers. The
first leg of the race is a quarter mile drag race between cars of the racers' choice.
The second lag is a 20 mile drag race on water between boats of the racers' choice.
The times for the races are added for each racer, and the racer with the shortest 
time is the winner.

For this, I first created a Vehicles superclass, and the derived classes Cars and Boats
which extend Vehicles. 

I create multiple options for cars and boats, and let the user choose amongst them
for each racer. Then the times are calculated and compared.
